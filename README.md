# RoadSafetyAnalysisWithQlikSense
This repository contains my road safety analysis of indian road 2019 as a part of my data analytics and visualizaions internship with SmartBridge 

## Hello! This is my project:
## INDIA IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT (2019 Indian Road Accidents)-A data-driven case study by C. Arshita.
This data-driven project analyzes 2019 Indian road accidents using Qlik. It explores how traffic data, weather, infrastructure, and demographics influence accidents.
Key Areas:
1. Accident patterns by location, time, and weather.
2. Accident severity variations across regions, roads, and vehicles.
3. Vulnerable road user (pedestrian, cyclist, motorcyclist) safety analysis.
4. Driver behavior (speeding, drunk driving, distractions) and accident risk.
5. Impact of control measures (traffic signals, police control) on accident rates.
6. Identifying vulnerable populations for targeted safety improvements.
Goal:
Leverage data insights to improve road safety and save lives in India (proactive approach, not accident prediction).
Tools:
Data Sources: Traffic data, accident reports, weather data, etc. (replace with your source if different)
Data Analysis & Visualization: Qlik Sense
